    "# Confidence Intervals\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range is which we are confident to a certain degree that a specific population parameter will fall. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, according to [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm), as of April 7th 2020, the mean salary for data scientists is \\\\$113,309. Now obviously glassdoor hasn't polled every working data scientist that exists to get to this number, meaning \\\\$113,309 is an estimate of the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we were to construct a 95% CI for this average and (just making up the numbers) got \\\\$100,000 - \\\\$115,000. This means that if we were to poll many times the average salary of __random__ samples of data scientists, than in 95% of those cases we would get an average salary that falls in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note most of the data used in this notebook for the examples originates from [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/). I highly recommend it!"

    "__Note:__ In this notebook every $\\sigma$ represents a population standard deviation while $s$ represents a sample standard deviation. Also $\\mu$ generally denotes the mean of some population, while $\\bar{x}$ denotes a sample mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\text{ME}$ = Margin of Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to be aware of in calculating CI's is when to use a Z (normal) distribution or a T distribution. In general when the population variance is known or the data you have is sufficiently big enough (usually 30+ samples is a good rule of thumb) you use a Z distribution. Otherwise use a T distribution which is meant for smaller amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly when using a T distribution you need to specify how many [Degrees of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)) it has. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which in general is just $\\text{the number of data points in the set} - 1$.\n",
