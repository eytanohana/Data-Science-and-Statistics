    "A confidence interval is a range is which we are confident to a certain degree that a specific population parameter will fall. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, according to [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm), as of April 7th 2020, the mean salary for data scientists is \\\\$113,309. Now obviously glassdoor hasn't polled every working data scientist that exists to get to this number, meaning \\\\$113,309 is an estimate of the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we were to construct a 95% CI for this average and (just making up the numbers) got \\\\$100,000 - \\\\$115,000. This means that if we were to poll many times the average salary of __random__ samples of data scientists, than in 95% of those cases we would get an average salary that falls in that range."
