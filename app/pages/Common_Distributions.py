# Distributions
A **Distribution** is just a set of values and the probabilities of getting those values.
From that we know that all the probabilities in the distribution should sum up to 100%.
There are two types of distributions.

**Discrete Distributions** are distributions that contain only discrete values like 1, 2, 3, ...

**Continuous Distributions** are distributions that can contain any value like 1.3 or 13.059
