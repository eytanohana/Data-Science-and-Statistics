st.markdown('''Covariance and Correlation describe the relationship between two variables.

>If two variables move in the same direction, we say they have a positive relationship.
>ie when one variable increases and the other does too, vice versa.
>
>If they move in opposite directions, then we say they have a negative relationship.
>ie when one variable increases and the other decreases, vice versa.
>
>And if they dont move together at all then we say they have no relationship.
>ie when one variable increases and the other one either increases or decreases.
